# My Electronics Learning Journey

What's an Atom?  
* An atom is the smallest unit of matter  
---
Different parts of Atom:  
1. Nucleus (center) -> [ Protons, Neutrons ]
2. Electrons -> They move around the nucleus in orbits

Electrons:  
* Very tiny and fast
* Negative charge (−)
* They decide how atoms interact (bonding or reactions)
* They live in energy levels (orbits)
* Each shell contains 2n² electron, where n = shell number
* Mass = 1/1836 of a proton
* Symbol: e⁻
* The closer the orbit = lower energy  
* Farther out = higher energy
* They can jump to higher levels if they get energy
* When they fall back down, they release energy
* Outer layer of electrons are called valence electrons
* Every electron has a tiny negative charge: `e = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ Coulombs`


Protons:   
* Positively charged particles in the atom’s nucleus 
* The number of protons is called the <u>atomic number</u> and defines the element type
* Symbol: p⁺
* Mass ≈ 1 atomic mass unit (amu)
* Very slightly lighter than a neutron
* Since protons are + and electrons are −, they attract each other. This keeps electrons near the nucleus

Neutron:
* A particle inside the atom’s nucleus
* It has no charge (neutral)
* Symbol: n⁰
* Same size as a proton
* Mass ≈ 1 atomic mass unit (amu)
* Acts like “glue” to keep protons together

Ionization:
* Atom loses or gains electrons → becomes an ion
  * Lose electron → positive ion
  * Gain electron → negative ion
---
Electron Transitions:
* Electrons jump to higher energy levels when given energy
* Fall back down → release light
---
Bonding:
* Atoms share or transfer electrons:
  * Ionic bonds → give/take electrons
  * Covalent bonds → share electrons
* Three types:
  1. Ionic Bond:  
    Electron is transferred from one atom to another  
    Usually between a metal and a non-metal
    Forms ions: one positive, one negative → they attract
  2. Covalent Bond:  
    Electrons are shared between atoms
    Usually between non-metals
    Strong bond, forms molecules
  3. Metallic Bond:  
    Between metal atoms
    Makes metals conductive and malleable

---
Nuclear Reactions:
* Happen inside the nucleus
* Protons and neutrons get added, removed, or changed
---
Radioactive Decay:
* Unstable atoms break down (wrong proton/neutron ratio) 
---

Metallic Bonding:
* In metals, atoms are packed tightly together
* The valence electrons are not held tightly
* So these electrons break free and move around like a “sea of electrons”
* The metal atoms turn into positive ions (they lost electrons)
* These positive ions are held together by the free-moving electrons around them
---
Ampere:  
* Coulomb of charge per second `1 Coulomb = 1 Ampere`
* How many electrons is 1 Coulomb? `1 Ampere = ~6.24 × 10¹⁸`
* Calculating current: `I = q / t`
* `I` = current (in amperes, A)
* `q` = total charge (in coulombs, C)
* `t` = time (in seconds)
